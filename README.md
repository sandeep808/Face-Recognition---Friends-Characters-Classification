# Face-Recognition-Friends-Characters-Classification

Intro :

In this section, I've included the code to build a dataset of faces (you'll manually have to sort them through though) and the code required to train a very simple VGG based model to recognize faces.

It's purpose is to demonstrate the shortcomings of using a regular CNN in face recognition and we'll later include more advanced Face Recognition Algorithms.

I've included the code to create our own face dataset from a video (Face Extraction from Video - Build Dataset.ipynb)

and the code required to train and test your model.

Using a simple VGG based CNN for facial recognition is not a good idea, later on I'll be introducing more advanced methods to do this more effectively.

The iPython Notebooks to load first are:

1. Face Extraction from Video - Build Dataset.ipynb

and then,

2. Face Recognition - Friends Characters - Train and Test
